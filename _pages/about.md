## About Me
 
I am a PhD Candidate in Organization Studies and Economic Sociology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. I am on the job market for the 2023-2024 year. In my research, I study diversity both within organizations and within markets. First, within organizations I study diversity of employee backgrounds in terms of culture, demographics, and expertise, as well as diversity of employee position in terms of status and authority. I ask how individuals coming from different backgrounds and occupying different positions can coordinate within organizations, and what organizations can do to facilitate success across these groups. Second, within markets, I study the ability of organizations to address a diversity of cultural tastes. With the ongoing development of markets in which organizations compete for the time and attention of individuals, the line is blurring between individuals as consumers and organizations as producers in markets. In markets such as online communities, open innovation, and gig-economy platforms, individuals can act on their cultural tastes not only by choosing which content to consume, but also which organizational spaces to join and shape. Whether these markets, and the organizations operating in them, can thrive depends on their ability to address a diversity of cultural tastes. I study these markets and contrast them with traditional consumer product markets. In pursuing these questions, I leverage both ethnographic and experimental methods, as well as quantitative analyses of social networks and text data. I pursue these questions with data from organizations in a range of industries including social media, finance, and scientific research labs.
