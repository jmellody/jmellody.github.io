## About Me
 
I am a PhD Candidate in Organization Studies and Economic Sociology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. I am on the job market for the 2023-2024 year.

My research

In my research, I study diversity both within organizations and within markets. First, within organizations I study diversity of employee backgrounds in terms of culture, demographics, and expertise, as well as diversity of employee position in terms of status and authority. I ask how individuals coming from different backgrounds and occupying different positions can coordinate within organizations, and what organizations can do to facilitate success across these groups. Second, within markets, I study the ability of organizations to address a diversity of cultural tastes. With the ongoing development of markets in which organizations compete for the time and attention of individuals, the line is blurring between individuals as consumers and organizations as producers in markets. In markets such as online communities, open innovation, and gig-economy platforms, individuals can act on their cultural tastes not only by choosing which content to consume, but also which organizational spaces to join and shape. Whether these markets, and the organizations operating in them, can thrive depends on their ability to address a diversity of cultural tastes. I study these markets and contrast them with traditional consumer product markets. In pursuing these questions, I leverage both ethnographic and experimental methods, as well as quantitative analyses of social networks and text data. I pursue these questions with data from organizations in a range of industries including social media, finance, and scientific research labs.

A Different Kind of Tradeoff: Partitioning in Markets for Time and Attention

What determines the diversity of cultural material produced in a market? In many consumer product markets, periods of competition support cultural diversity, but alternating periods of concentration drive cultural homogeneity. A stable partition can emerge, separating a culturally homogenous market center from a culturally diverse periphery. Cultural diversity exists temporarily, or is relegated to the market fringe. These conditions are reflected in the particular choice faced by organizations: grow in the market center by producing culturally generic material, or attract a smaller, engaged consumer base by producing culturally distinct material in the periphery. I examine a different kind of market: markets for time and attention, in which consumers can readily engage with multiple organizations simultaneously and easily transition from consumers to also producers of content. I study Reddit as a case of an attention market, leveraging user participation data and the text of over 2 billion comments from numerous subreddits. I find that subreddits face a different kind of tradeoff underlying a different capacity for culturally diverse material: cultural diversity thrives in dense, competitive areas of the resource space, while cultural homogeneity emerges in sparse, uncompetitive areas. I draw on these findings to introduce a broader theory of market partitioning.

## Working Papers

Recent work describes expertise as a network of actors working together to solve problems. Professionals pass on their knowledge to other actors—often clients, empowering them as co-experts. Research has shown that this deep coordination can improve problem solving relative to traditional professional-client relationships. These networks depend not only on professionals’ generosity to share knowledge, but also on clients’ willingness to welcome empowerment. I examine a setting where clients avoid, rather than welcome, empowerment, and ask how professionals can build networks of expertise in the face of such resistance. I specifically investigate coordination within organizations between staff professionals handling various kinds of infrastructure work and their production worker clients. These clients often resist involvement in infrastructure work which they view as low status—work for example in human resources, information technology, and safety. Leveraging ethnographic data of safety professionals in a research setting, I identify a two-part process through which professionals can raise the status of their work and build networks of expertise. First, professionals apprentice themselves in the work of the client, learning holistically about client work and modeling a learning mindset for clients. Second, professionals mentor clients, drawing on their apprenticeship to tailor their expertise to local contexts of client work. Doing so raises the status of the professional’s work by displaying its relevance to clients’ work. Clients recognize the importance of the professional’s work and welcome empowerment to become co-experts. Additionally, clients proactively share knowledge of their local work contexts back with professionals—a commingling of expertise.
