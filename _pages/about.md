I am a PhD Candidate in Organization Studies and Economic Sociology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. My research focuses on diversity within markets and organizations. I am driven to understand markets and organizations as collectives of individuals--from diverse backgrounds, occupying diverse positions, and with diverse tastes. First, I study markets in the attention economy where organizations--such as online communities, platforms for gig-work and open innovation, social movements, and voluntary organizations--compete for the time and attention of individuals not only as consumers, but also producers of content. I ask what kinds of tradeoffs these organizations face and how these tradeoffs relate to the market's overall capacity to produce a diversity of cultural material. Within organizations, I study how people from diverse backgrounds and occupying diverse positions can coordinate across knowledge, functional, and cultural boundaries.

In pursuing these questions, I leverage quantitative analyses of social networks and text data, as well as ethnographic and experimental methods. I pursue these questions with data from organizations in a range of industries including social media, finance, and scientific research labs.

I am on the job market for the 2023-2024 academic year. My CV can be found <a href="files/Mellody_CV_2023.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
