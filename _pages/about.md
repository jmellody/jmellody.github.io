I am a PhD Candidate in Organization Studies and Economic Sociology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. I am an organization theorist studying culture and coordination within competitive ecologies and organizations. With the expansion of the internet and remote work, digital platforms and online communities are becoming increasingly important sites of social and economic life. In my first line of work, I study an online community as an example of an “attention ecology”—an ecology defined by competition for users’ time and attention. I ask what strategic tradeoffs producers face in this ecology, and how they can serve a diversity of cultural tastes. In this work, I leverage large-scale quantitative analyses of text data and social networks. In a second line of work, I study how diverse individuals coordinate effectively within organizations—through organizational initiatives around culture as well as individual and team-level practices. In this work, I leverage qualitative methods (i.e., ethnographic and interview studies) and experimental methods. I pursue these questions with data from organizations in a range of industries including social media, finance, and scientific research labs. For my dissertation work, I have been selected as a finalist in the 2023 INFORMS/Organization Science Dissertation Proposal Competition.

I am on the job market for the 2023-2024 academic year. My CV can be found <a href="files/Mellody_CV_2023.pdf" target="_self">here.</a>
