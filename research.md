A Different Kind of Tradeoff: Partitioning in Markets for Time and Attention

What determines the diversity of cultural material produced in a market? In many consumer product markets, periods of competition support cultural diversity, but alternating periods of concentration drive cultural homogeneity. A stable partition can emerge, separating a culturally homogenous market center from a culturally diverse periphery. Cultural diversity exists temporarily, or is relegated to the market fringe. These conditions are reflected in the particular choice faced by organizations: grow in the market center by producing culturally generic material, or attract a smaller, engaged consumer base by producing culturally distinct material in the periphery. I examine a different kind of market: markets for time and attention, in which consumers can readily engage with multiple organizations simultaneously and easily transition from consumers to also producers of content. I study Reddit as a case of an attention market, leveraging user participation data and the text of over 2 billion comments from numerous subreddits. I find that subreddits face a different kind of tradeoff underlying a different capacity for culturally diverse material: cultural diversity thrives in dense, competitive areas of the resource space, while cultural homogeneity emerges in sparse, uncompetitive areas. I draw on these findings to introduce a broader theory of market partitioning.
