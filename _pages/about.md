I am a PhD Candidate in Organization Studies and Economic Sociology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. My work sits at the intersection of technology, strategy, and organization theory. In a first stream of work, I leverage large-scale quantitative analyses of user interaction and text data to study online communities and digital platforms as increasingly important sites of economic and social life. I pursue specific questions including: how do online communities compete for the attention of users, how do digital platforms offer new contexts for the crowdsourced production of innovative ideas for firms and entrepreneurial ventures, how do online communities impact financial markets through collective action, and how do online communities evolve over time and manage contributions from diverse users? In a second stream of work, I conduct experiments and multi-year ethnographic studies of traditional organizations (e.g., scientific research laboratories and financial institutions) to examine how individuals and groups leverage technology to coordinate across differences. For my dissertation work, I was selected as a finalist in the 2023 INFORMS/Organization Science Dissertation Proposal Competition.

I am on the job market during the 2023-2024 academic year. My CV can be found <a href="files/Mellody_CV_2023.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
