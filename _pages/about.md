I am a PhD Candidate in Organization Studies and Economic Sociology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. My research focuses on diversity at two levels: markets and organizations. At the market level, I study markets in which individuals are not only consumers but also producers of content--organizations, and the diversity of cultural material that they produce, reflect the tastes and actions of their individual members. At the organizational level, I study how people from diverse backgrounds and occupying diverse positions can work together. A common idea running through my research is that we can understand organizations and individuals as a duality.

In pursuing these questions, I leverage both ethnographic and experimental methods, as well as quantitative analyses of social networks and text data. I pursue these questions with data from organizations in a range of industries including social media, finance, and scientific research labs.

I am on the job market for the 2023-2024 academic year. My CV can be found <a href="files/Mellody_CV_2023.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
