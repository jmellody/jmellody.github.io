## Concerted Quantification: How Expert Teams Reconcile Overwork and Client Satisfaction (with Vanessa Conzon)

### Conditionally Accepted at *Organization Science*

White-collar employees are increasingly overworking, with negative individual and organizational consequences. Pressures for long intense hours often come from clients and are reinforced by coworkers’ concertive controls, and the increasing quantification of work has, in many cases, tightened such controls. We examine if and how employees might rely upon quantification to, in contrast, limit overwork. We draw on data from a 21-month ethnography of teams of IT professionals who work for clients in finance. We find that while these workers faced pressure to overwork, they managed this tension through a process we label “concerted quantification.” In this process, team members commensurate tasks into smaller numeric units that are then summed into a larger numeric figure that represents the work the team will accomplish in a two-week period. They then leverage this quantification in two ways: to openly justify maintaining their workload, particularly when facing peer pressure to take on more work, by pointing to numbers as collective, codified team decisions; and to obscure work changes from clients. To support these actions, workers legitimize quantification to clients. Overall, we find that quantifying processes both (a) help teams determine an appropriate amount of work to take on without engaging in overwork, and (b) set clients’ expectations of success in this context of expert, professional work. We contribute to research on overwork, concertive control, and quantification by highlighting how quantification, through opaqueness and transparency, can allow white-collar workers to limit overwork.

# Under Review

## [Title omitted for peer review] (with Ezra Zuckerman Sivan and Catresa Barlow)

We develop and test the longstanding sociological conjecture that the social construction of the seven-day week is reproduced via a deeply internalized sense of temporal orientation resulting from subtle social cues. The rare opportunity for such a test arises from the combination of a) mass quarantine at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which muted the distinct cues associated with the days of the week; and b) the popularity of a social media platform (Twitter) where millions seek real-time social validation for their experience. We find that in the wake of the pandemic lockdowns, expressions of temporal disorientation spiked; that such disorientation was primarily expressed as confusion as to the day of the week; and that the otherwise notable contrast between weekend and weekday was insignificant. We also find a minor version of this “blursday” effect outside the pandemic, as a result of mid-week holidays. Finally, we advance theory on temporal consciousness by showing that whereas the pandemic onset elicited a spike in “disorientation consciousness,” the key political moments of early 2021 (the Capitol Insurrection and the inauguration of President Biden) elicited expressions of historical consciousness.

## Allocating Attention: Cultural Exploration in Online Communities

The internet promised to facilitate cultural exploration by loosening structural constraints, but research has found that attention allocation online resembles offline patterns in which a few generic communities attract the bulk of attention while specialty communities remain small. Past work focused on analyzing the distribution of attention—not accounting for individuals’ ability to engage simultaneously with multiple communities online. Using data from the online platform
Reddit, I leverage an ecological perspective to examine connections between online communities by independently measuring the position of communities in a structural space, based on membership, and a cultural space, based on content. I find that, rather than relying on a primarily separate set of individuals than generic communities like in the offline world, specialty communities can share members with even the largest, most generic communities online, reflecting cultural exploration at the individual level and connections between culturally distinct communities.

## Cheap Talk: Coordinating and Fracturing Collective Action through Language

Research on collective action highlights the importance of language in motivating participation and coordinating action. I argue that language which is effective at motivating and coordinating new joiners can also play a role in fracturing the collective. This is because the synthesis required to succinctly pitch a cause can overly simplify its core tenets. New joiners can quickly understand and easily signal their participation in a cause by engaging in this “cheap talk”—but their understanding and participation may be surface level, aligned with a particular element of the cause but critically misaligned with the broader culture of the existing group. I study this phenomenon in the context of the 2021 short squeeze of the GameStop stock. I leverage data from the Reddit community r/wallstreetbets, where the short squeeze was largely coordinated. I find that the usage of meme language increased leading up to the short squeeze, and that new joiners adopted this language more quickly and with more intensity than pre-existing users. While this talk facilitated an increase in membership and coordination around the time of the short squeeze, it became a source of contention in the months and years after the squeeze, transforming into a cultural fault line distinguishing hype-driven “meme” investors from pre-existing community members.

## Narrating Value: How Staff Professionals Form Embedded Relationships with Line Workers

This paper examines how staff professionals can form embedded relationships with line workers. Common organizational narratives paint the work of staff professionals as peripheral to core organizational goals, fueling conditions of low status and authority that make it difficult for staff professionals to win the cooperation of line workers. Past research has shown that staff professionals can achieve some authority by establishing client service relationships with line workers. On its own, however, such an approach emphasizes staff-line distinctions, reinforcing existing narratives and limiting relational development. Drawing on an 18-month ethnographic study of environmental, health, and safety practices within a university setting, this paper illustrates a multistage, interactional process through which staff professionals changed existing narratives and built embedded partnerships that served as the basis of greater contribution. First, similar to past work, staff professionals built a foundation of authority—doing so by approaching short, simple interactions with line workers as service transactions. Then, staff professionals developed embedded relationships by approaching lengthy, complex interactions as collaborations, engaging in a process of knowledge sharing to co-create core work. Over time, staff professionals cemented their position as integral contributors to core work processes—change reflected in both narrative and relational development.

## Beyond Representation: Extending the Effectiveness of Diversity Approaches via Individuation (with Ray Reagans)

Organizations face two main options for managing diversity: a “colorblind” approach that minimizes differences by valuing equality and a “multicultural” approach that highlights, and thereby values, differences. Emerging research emphasizes the importance of demographic representation in shaping the appeal of either approach to women and people of color. While this helps to make sense of why these groups respond better to different approaches, it introduces a tradeoff. Because these groups are usually represented at different levels within organizations, managers may have to choose between creating a culture that benefits women or people of color, but not both. Building on a connection between representation and a more general idea of individuation, this paper argues that individuation offers a more malleable contingency along which the effectiveness of a diversity approach varies. The benefit of a more malleable contingency is that it enables managers to foster alignment. We predict that this alignment will in turn enable a single diversity approach to work for all demographic groups. In an experiment, we find support for our predictions. First, we find that the effectiveness of a diversity approach varies with individuation. Second, we find that aligning different demographic groups on their level of individuation softens the tradeoff between choosing a “colorblind” or “multicultural” approach, such that all groups perform as well or better under one approach compared to the other.
