I am a PhD Candidate in Organization Studies and Economic Sociology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. I am an organizational sociologist studying culture and coordination in two key settings: online communities and traditional organizations. I am fascinated by the idea that online communities and organizations reflect the coordinated action of many individuals with diverse backgrounds, expertise, and positions, and who pursue a variety of cultural tastes. I study these interests through two main research streams: (1) within online communities, I examine how attention is allocated to different kinds of communities—speaking to how online communities navigate the entrepreneurial process of identifying a need and finding an audience, as well as to how the internet relates to broader societal questions around cultural homogeneity versus diversity; (2) within organizations, I examine how individuals coordinate across their differences—through organizational initiatives around culture as well as individual and team-level practices. In my work, I leverage computational social science methods, as well as experimental and qualitative methods (i.e., ethnographic observations and interviews). I study organizations across a range of industries, including social media, finance, and scientific research. For my dissertation work, I was selected as a finalist in the 2023 INFORMS/ Organization Science Dissertation Proposal Competition.

I am on the job market during the 2023-2024 academic year. My CV can be found <a href="files/Mellody_CV_2023.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
