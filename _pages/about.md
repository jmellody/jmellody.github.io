I am a PhD Candidate in Organization Studies and Economic Sociology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. I am on the job market for the 2023-2024 year. My research examines diversity both within organizations and markets. Within organizations, I study diversity in terms of employee backgrounds as well as position. Within markets, study the ability of organizations to address a variety of tastes. In pursuing these questions, I leverage both ethnographic and experimental methods, as well as quantitative analyses of social networks and text data. I pursue these questions with data from organizations in a range of industries including social media, finance, and scientific research labs.
