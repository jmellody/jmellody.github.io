Recent work describes expertise as a network of actors working together to solve problems. 
Professionals pass on their knowledge to other actors—often clients, empowering them as co-experts. 
Research has shown that this deep coordination can improve problem solving relative to traditional 
professional-client relationships. These networks depend not only on professionals’ generosity to 
share knowledge, but also on clients’ willingness to welcome empowerment. I examine a setting where 
clients avoid, rather than welcome, empowerment, and ask how professionals can build networks of 
expertise in the face of such resistance. I specifically investigate coordination within organizations 
between staff professionals handling various kinds of infrastructure work and their production worker 
clients. These clients often resist involvement in infrastructure work which they view as low 
status—work for example in human resources, information technology, and safety. Leveraging 
ethnographic data of safety professionals in a research setting, I identify a two-part process 
through which professionals can raise the status of their work and build networks of expertise. 
First, professionals apprentice themselves in the work of the client, learning holistically about 
client work and modeling a learning mindset for clients. Second, professionals mentor clients, 
drawing on their apprenticeship to tailor their expertise to local contexts of client work. Doing 
so raises the status of the professional’s work by displaying its relevance to clients’ work. 
Clients recognize the importance of the professional’s work and welcome empowerment to become 
co-experts. Additionally, clients proactively share knowledge of their local work contexts back 
with professionals—a commingling of expertise.
