I am a PhD Candidate in Organization Studies and Economic Sociology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. My research focuses on diversity at two levels: I study markets, and the organizations within them, as collectives of individuals from diverse backgrounds, occupying diverse positions, and with diverse tastes. First, I study markets in the attention economy in which both digital platforms (e.g., online communities and open innovation hubs) and more traditional organizations (e.g., social movement and voluntary organizations) compete for the time and attention of individuals not only as consumers, but also as producers of content. I ask how these organizations can succeed in attracting member resources and how this reflects the market's overall capacity to produce content addressing the diversity of cultural tastes. Within organizations, I study how people from diverse backgrounds and occupying diverse positions can coordinate across knowledge, functional, and cultural boundaries, as well as what organizations can do to facilitate this coordination. In pursuing these questions, I leverage quantitative analyses of social networks and text data, as well as ethnographic and experimental methods. I pursue these questions with data from organizations in a range of industries including social media, finance, and scientific research labs.

I am on the job market for the 2023-2024 academic year. My CV can be found <a href="files/Mellody_CV_2023.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
